## Hi there 👋

# I'm David

I solve complex technical problems quickly and reliably, across a wide range of disciplines: from **embedded hardware and microcontrollers** to **Python, C++, and Kotlin programming**, from **TTL logic and PCB design** to system automation and security monitoring. I even bring creativity to technical projects, including **illustrated workflows and educational tools**.

My work is focused on **practical results**, delivering solutions that just work, whether it's a small Linux automation script, a proof-of-concept embedded device, or a custom software tool. I specialize in taking an idea or pain point and turning it into a **robust, functional solution** — fast.

## My Capabilities

- **Embedded Systems & Hardware**: ESP32, ATTiny, LED matrices, custom PCB design, TTL logic circuits
- **Programming & Scripting**: Python, C++, Kotlin, Bash, Shell scripting
- **Linux & Automation**: System monitoring, file integrity, network and security tools, automation scripts
- **Creative & Technical Projects**: Educational kits, workflow tools, text and mobile games, illustrative guides

## Featured Repositories

- [Illustrated Book Workflow](https://github.com/TheHackersWorkshop/illustrated-book-blueprint) – Creative automation and publishing workflows

## How I Can Help

I take on **fixed-scope projects** and deliver complete, functional solutions. Examples include:

- Custom embedded hardware prototypes and ESP32 solutions
- Linux automation and monitoring tools
- Software development across multiple languages (Python, C++, Kotlin, Bash)
- Educational or creative technology projects

If you need a versatile problem solver who can **design, code, build, and deliver** solutions across hardware, software, and creative workflows, I can help.

📫 **Reach out to collaborate or hire me** — I focus on results and practical solutions, delivered reliably and efficiently.
